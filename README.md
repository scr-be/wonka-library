## Overview

[Welcome](https://scr.be/go/readme_welcome)!
The `scr-be/wonka-library` package provides
a collection of framework-agnostic classes, interfaces, traits, and root-namespace functions used as the building blocks for other projects.

### Grouping

This package is part of the [wonka](https://scr.be/wonka-library/group)
group ([explanation](https://scr.be/wonka-library/group_explanation)),
comprised of other releases with a concentration in 
*core, rudimentary routines*,
and related functionality.

### JTT

This package represents a single project within a
[large collection](https://scr.be/go/explore) of open-source code released
under the *Scribe* namespace, comprised of framework-agnostic libraries,
and a number of Symfony bundles. These projects are authored and maintained
by [Rob Frawley 2nd](https://scr.be/rmf) and 
[collaborators](https://scr.be/wonka-library/github_collaborators),
often with the support of [Scribe Inc](https://scr.be/go/scribe-home).

## Quick Start

### Installation

Get the code by requiring it explicitly via the [Composer](https://getcomposer.com)
CLI, or by editing your *composer.json* to reflect the dependency and updating
your project requirements. For example, to explicitly require this project using
the CLI, use the following command.

```bash
$ composer require scr-be/wonka-library
```

## Reference

### API Docs

This package's API-documentation is available at [scr.be/wonka-library/api](https://scr.be/wonka-library/api),
(as well as linked below via the *Reference* badge found under the *Additional Links*
header). All API-reference is build against the *master* Git branch and updated
automatically on each Git push---api-reference for *specific releases* will
be provided once this package has matured.

> The entire API-reference website is auto-generated using a quick,
> reliable, and well-developed CLI tool called [Sami](https://scr.be/go/sami).
> It is rigerously and regularly tested through its use in large, complex projects,
> such as the [Symfony Full-Stack Framework](https://scr.be/go/symfony) 
> <see: [scr.be/go/api-ref-symfony](https://scr.be/go/symfony-api)>, as well
> as its use in smaller projects such
> [Twig](https://scr.be/go/sami-twig)
> <see: [scr.be/go/api-ref-twig](https://scr.be/go/twig-api)>.
> Reference Sami's [GitHub page](https://scr.be/go/sami) to learn how to use
> it with your own projects!

### Examples/Tutorials

Currently, there is no *"human-written"* documentation---outside of this README.
Pending package stability and available resources, a
[RTD (Read the Docs)](https://scr.be/go/rtd) page will be published with
additional information and tutorials, including real use-cases within the Symfony
Framework.
